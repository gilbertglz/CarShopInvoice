# CarShopInvoice

## Overview
This project is an update to a project I once made when I worked for a Car Shop Office during High School.
Invoices were made using Excel or Google Sheets but were made, essentially, from scratch everytime.
This project was meant to streamline that process and maintain a "local" memory of the invoice items usually used.
Out of the lack of a database, a text file is used to maintain the items usually used to be recalled at a later day.

## Features
- Creates a PDF file that is formatted to hold the invoice items, quantity, price per item, and total.
- Automatically adds them onto the PDF at print
- Allows for Tax rate to be changed at adding items, or prior to completely writing the PDF
